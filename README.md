## Calendar Commander
Calendar Commander is a web application that will remove the frustration and confusion associated with creating a working schedule based on UMass Academic Requirements. The goal is to break down the ARR into a simplistic manner which simply generates suitable schedules for students that will help them graduate and understand what is required of them. Students at UMass are welcome to use this application, as it will provide a clear outline of valid next-semester schedules.

## Topics
 1. Data Storage - ElephantSQL to manage course/academic requirements                    and schedules for students
 2. Server-Side - Express and calculations of schedules will be done                    on the server and sent to the client
